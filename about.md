<p>I work as a Senior Quantitative User Experience researcher at Google.
<br>
I finished my PhD at University of California Santa Cruz working under Steve Whittaker in 2019. Broadly, I characterize my research as Human-Centered AI research. This research includes work on fairness such as the 'Play PRBLMS' paper where we explore how voice interfaces disadvantage specific ways of speaking. Under the human-centered AI umbrella, my research also focuses on transparency and explainable AI. I explore how systems should explain their predictions to humans in ways that we trust and understand.  I previously interned at Xerox PARC under Peter Pirolli, at Spotify under Henriette Cramer, and at Google under Joy Thomas.
