<p>I am a 5th year PhD candidate at University of California Santa Cruz working under Steve Whittaker. My research focuses on the interaction between User Experience and Machine Learning. Additionally, I research algorithmic bias; how to detect and counter the societal biases that many algorithms are implicitly learning. I have interned at Xerox PARC under Peter Pirolli, at Spotify under Henriette Cramer, and at Google under Joy Thomas..</p>
