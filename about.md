<p>I am a 4th year PhD candidate at University of California Santa Cruz working under Steve Whittaker. My research focuses on the interaction between User Experience and Machine Learning. Additionally, I research algorithmic bias; how to detect and counter the societal biases that many algorithms are implicitly learning. I have interned at Xerox PARC under Peter Pirolli and at Spotify under Henriette Cramer.</p>

<p>Outside of my research, I spend a lot of time outdoors. I'm lucky enough to live in Santa Cruz California where I can run through the redwoods, bike along Highway 1, and surf under a beautiful sunset all in one day. I serve as the President of the Graduate Student Commons at UCSC, a student organization dedicated to building community among graduate students and support their mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
